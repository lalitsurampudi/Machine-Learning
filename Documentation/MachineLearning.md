## Accuracy paradox
    - [Ref](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/)
    - Only measuring your modelâ€™s accuracy is not just enough in practical scenarios hence other metrics like precision and recall. This becomes specifically important when you have an imbalanced dataset although that is not the case here. You would not want to fall in the trap of accuracy paradox.
